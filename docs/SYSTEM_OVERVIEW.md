# 📊 System Overview - CoinDCX Futures Trading Signals

## What We Built

A professional, production-ready trading signal system that monitors 377 futures pairs on CoinDCX and sends instant alerts for high-probability trading opportunities.

---

## 🎯 Core Components

### 1. **Scanner Engine** (`scanner.py`)
- Fetches live price data from CoinDCX API
- Monitors 377 futures pairs simultaneously
- Maintains rolling price history (100 data points per coin)
- Smart caching to reduce API calls
- Automatic retry logic for reliability

### 2. **Technical Indicators** (`indicators.py`) - **Professional Grade**
- **RSI (14-period with Wilder's smoothing):** ✅ Verified correct, matches TradingView
- **ATR (14-period):** Dynamic volatility-based stops, adapts to market conditions
- **MACD (12/26/9):** Industry standard (Gerald Appel's original)
- **Bollinger Bands (20, 2σ):** Industry standard (John Bollinger's original)
- **EMA Trend Filter (20/50):** Only trades with the trend (major win rate boost)
- **Divergence Detection:** RSI vs price for high-probability reversals
- **Support/Resistance:** Auto-detected key levels
- **Enhanced Volume:** OBV + relative volume + 2x surge detection
- **Price Momentum:** Multi-bar trend strength

**All formulas verified against:**
- Academic literature (Wilder 1978, Appel 1970s, Bollinger 1980s)
- TradingView, MetaTrader, Bloomberg

### 3. **Signal Generator** (`signal_generator.py`) - **Smart Weighted System**
- Evaluates all indicators simultaneously with weighted scoring
- Requires minimum 3 indicators (was 2)
- Scores opportunities 0-100% confidence
- **Weighted Confidence:**
  - Trend Filter: 1.5× (most important)
  - Divergence: 1.3× (high probability)
  - MACD: 1.2×
  - Support/Resistance: 1.1×
  - RSI, Volume: 1.0×
  - Momentum: 0.8×
- Trend alignment bonus: +10%
- Conflicting signals penalty: -5% each
- Ranks signals by quality
- Sends only top 2-3 signals to avoid spam
- 2-minute cooldown per coin

**Signal Logic:**
- **Strong (85%+):** 3+ indicators aligned with trend
- **Moderate (70-84%):** 3 indicators, partial alignment
- **Weak (<70%):** Filtered out

### 4. **Risk Manager** (`risk_manager.py`) - **Advanced**
- Calculates position sizing based on capital & risk%
- **ATR-based dynamic stops** (optional): Adapts to market volatility
  - Calm market → Tighter stops
  - Volatile market → Wider stops
- Fixed stop-loss: 0.5% (if ATR disabled)
- Sets take-profit targets (0.9%, 1.8%)
- Validates risk:reward ratio (minimum 1:1.5)
- Tracks concurrent positions (max 3)
- Factors in 0.6% transaction costs (GST)

### 5. **Account Manager** (`account_manager.py`) - Personalized Mode
- Connects to CoinDCX API (read-only)
- Fetches available margin in real-time
- Tracks open positions automatically
- Calculates dynamic position sizes
- Prevents over-leveraging

### 6. **Alert System** (`alerter.py`)
- Multi-channel: Discord & Telegram
- Rich formatted messages
- Entry signals with complete trade plan
- Exit signals when targets/stop-loss hit
- Position updates during active trades
- Daily summary at market close

### 7. **Scheduler** (`main.py`)
- Runs 11 AM - 5 PM IST (configurable)
- Scans every 1-5 seconds (configurable)
- Auto-starts and stops daily
- Graceful error handling
- Performance monitoring
